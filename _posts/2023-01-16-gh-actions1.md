title: What are Github Actions?
excerpt: A simple CI/CD platform with all fixins'.
---

Up until recently I hadn't had a ton of opportunities to really dig my fingers into all that Github had to offer. I had
only been hosting some of my random and test repos there. Essentially just a remote location to `push` | `pull` to/from.
My general workflow would often be some form of development in a dev branch, maybe opening up a pull request and eventuanlly merging my changes into main.
The "basics". Any downstream CI/CD steps (if what I was working on required any) would often be handled outside of Github. For instance,
I used to have an entire Jenkins server setup to handle testing and linting of a repo. Although not *THAT* much of a hassle,
working with Jenkins did add additional server maintenance steps that I often didn't have time for (read: I just plain didn't want to do that). ðŸ˜­

So, when I began to hear about what was possible with Github Actions my interest was peaked. I had seen the "Actions" tab in all of my repositories,
but I never took the time to really get to the bottom of what was inside there.

Github defines Actions as the [following](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions):

> GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

To overly simplify things. Github Actions allows you, the developer, to write your own custom "workflows" where you define step-by-step what actions should
happen after your workflow has been triggered. Even better, is that you can leverage already built workflow steps by looking through the
Github Marketplace. I'm going to take the next few posts to break down into more detail one particular Github Actions Workflow I put together and use a lot.

I'd like to just quickly summarize what it actually does. When triggered, the workflow looks for modifications made to specific files in the repo.
If any of those files were, indeed, touched the workflow proceeds to deploy changes to two targets: Prefect Cloud, and Google Cloud Platform.
This workflow handles all of the CI/CD needed to add and maintain mission critical ELT pipelines. All without ever leaving Github.
