<p>I recently traveled out west to see an old buddy of mine.  L.A. always seems to open my eyes up to new things.  While there this time, I was introduced to Processing and P5.js.  This might need a little bit of back story, but let me preface everything that follows by stating that I am a pretty boring dude.  I like numbers and textbooks, but seeing what kind of visual stuff was easily possible left a lasting impression on me.</p>

<p>I (after watching a few youtube videos by Dan Shiffman working in <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a>) was able to create the following purple rain example using the P5.js library.  Initially, I was not really looking forward to working with Javascript, but having something THIS visual helped to get me excited about the entire process. Wellâ€¦that, and some of the interactive stuff others were doing incorporating other peripherals like the Kinect.</p>

<p>Definitely a welcome change from staring at SQL databases all day.</p>
