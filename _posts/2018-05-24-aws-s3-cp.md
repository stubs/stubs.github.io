title: Read Files on AWS S3 Without Copying As A Local File

excerpt: Not sure what's in a file in an S3 bucket?  Peak inside it without having to copy it on to your machine.
---

Lots of people use Amazon's S3 buckets. I tend to use them to save some random csv
data to look play around with later.  Every once and a while I'd come across a different key path in one of my S3 buckets
and just be completely puzzled as to what kind of stuff I had placed in there.  Selecting a file and taking
a look isn't terribly hard.  Essentially, I would `aws s3 cp` the file from the s3 bucket to my local machine.
From there, one can use any variety of Unix tools to get a better idea of the data contained in said file.
See...pretty simple, but it got annoying having to eventually remove the copied local file after I would
look through it and see that its contents were not what I was looking for.

For a while I simply cursed the heavens for the lack of AWS S3 commands that would perform similarly to the way
`cat` does.  These were truly *hard times*. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised that this behavior could still
be recreated without having to actually create a local version of the s3 file to your file system.

`aws s3 cp <S3Uri> -` will allow you to skip copying the file to your local machine prior to checking inside with
`head`, `tail`, `cat`, etc.

Let's see it in action by peeking into some [Amazon customer review data](https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews/)
that is stored in a public S3 bucket.

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Software_v1_00.tsv.gz - | gunzip -c | head
```
