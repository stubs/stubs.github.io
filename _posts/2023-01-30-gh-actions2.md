title: What are Github Actions? - Part 2
excerpt: A quick intro to workflow triggers and Github Action env vars.
---

Last time I shared an entire Github Actions workflow script.  In this post I'll take a little bit of a deeper dive into only a few of sections of the YAML syntax for workflows.
Let's take a look at today's relevant sections again.

{% raw %}
```yaml
name: Sample GH Action Workflow


on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      SUB_DIR:
        required: true
        type: string
      ENVIRONMENT:
        required: true
        type: string
      PROJECT:
        required: true
        type: string
      REGION:
        required: true
        type: string
      ZONE:
        required: true
        type: string
      GCP_AR_REPO:
        required: true
        type: string


env:
  SUB_DIR: ${{ inputs.SUB_DIR }}
  WORKINGDIR: ints/${{ inputs.SUB_DIR }}
  WORK_QUEUE: ${{ inputs.ENVIRONMENT }}
  ENVIRONMENT: ${{ inputs.ENVIRONMENT }}
  PROJECT: ${{ inputs.PROJECT }}
  REGION: ${{ inputs.REGION }}
  ZONE: ${{ inputs.ZONE }}
  GCP_AR_REPO: ${{ inputs.GCP_AR_REPO }}
  GCE_INSTANCE: prefect-docker-${{ inputs.ENVIRONMENT }}-vm
  GCE_INSTANCE_ZONE: ${{ inputs.REGION }}-${{ inputs.ZONE }}
```
{% endraw %}


## name
The first of our yaml keywords here is `name`. `name`, unsurprisingly names the github actions workflow.  You can toss any thing you want here, and you'll be able
to identify the workflow by this `name` value in Github's Action tab.

## on
This is where things start to get a little more interesting. `on` allows us to configure what types of actions can potentially "trigger" our workflows. There are variety
of available [events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows). For this introduction I have chosen one
we can have complete control over. `workflow_dispatch` ensures that a workflow will only trigger once we have manually taken the steps to kick if off ourselves. In Github
we can see visually see if a particular workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` event trigger by selecting a workflow and seeing if Github explicitly confirms this configuration (see
the screen shot below for an example).

In our example I utilized `inputs`.  With `inputs` you can optionally specify inputs that are passed to the workflow.  This option can allow you to write more general workflows
that can easily be re-used depending on what inputs you choose to pass in. I tend to use this option a lot.  Albeit not all of the `inputs` change often. For instance, I don't often
deploy to different cloud regions or zones, but I will almost always pass in the value `dev` for `ENVIRONMENT` to have my workflow string format `dev` as a suffix or prefix in the names of any infrastructure my CI/CD workflow
creates. Once things are looking the way I want I'll update that `ENVIRONMENT` input value to `prod` prior to having the workflow run one last time. Your mileage may vary, but I find inputs
to be a powerful option.

## env
Our last workflow section for today is `env`. This kind of goes hand-in-hand with `inputs`. Here we are able to hardcode any environment variables we want to have available for our use
further downstream in the workflow. My general use pattern tends to be to surface any `inputs` here, and possibly concatenate them with any other required strings that my workflow needs.
There are some limitations to note here! Variables in the env map cannot be defined in terms of other variables in the map. We'll discuss how you access these environment variables in the my upcoming
posts, but for the time being we can think about using these workflow env vars similar to how we could use shell env vars. For example, if we launched this workflow with an input value of `dir1` for `SUB_DIR`,
`cd $WORKINGDIR` would interpolate to `cd ints/dir1`.
