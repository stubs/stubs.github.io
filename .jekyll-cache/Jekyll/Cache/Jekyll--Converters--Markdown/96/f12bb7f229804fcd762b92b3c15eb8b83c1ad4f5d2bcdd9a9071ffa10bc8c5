I"	<p>Lots of people use Amazon’s S3 buckets. I tend to use them to save some random csv
data to look play around with later.  Every once and a while I’d come across a different key path in one of my S3 buckets
and just be completely puzzled as to what kind of stuff I had placed in there.  Selecting a file and taking
a look isn’t terribly hard.  Essentially, I would <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws s3 cp</code> the file from the s3 bucket to my local machine.
From there, one can use any variety of Unix tools to get a better idea of the data contained in said file.
See…pretty simple, but it got annoying having to eventually remove the copied local file after I would
look through it and see that its contents were not what I was looking for.</p>

<p>For a while I simply cursed the heavens for the lack of AWS S3 commands that would perform similarly to the way
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> does.  These were truly <em>hard times</em>. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised that this behavior could still
be recreated without having to actually create a local version of the s3 file to your file system.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws s3 cp &lt;S3Uri&gt; -</code> will allow you to skip copying the file to your local machine prior to checking inside with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tail</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Let’s see it in action by peeking into some <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews/">Amazon customer review data</a>
that is stored in a public S3 bucket. The code snippet below allows me to unzip the compressed tab separated value file
and print out only the first row of the file.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
