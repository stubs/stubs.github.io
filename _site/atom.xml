   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently traveled out west to see an old buddy of mine.  L.A. always seems to open my eyes up to new things.  While there this time, I was introduced to Processing and P5.js.  This might need a little bit of back story, but let me preface everything that follows by stating that I am a pretty boring dude.  I like numbers and textbooks, but seeing what kind of visual stuff was easily possible left a lasting impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (after watching a few youtube videos by Dan Shiffman working in &lt;a href=&quot;https://processing.org&quot;&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;) was able to create the following purple rain example using the P5.js library.  Initially, I was not really looking forward to working with Javascript, but having someting THIS visual helped to get me excited about the entire process. Wellâ€¦that, and some of the interactive stuff others were doing incorporating other peripherals like the Kinect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely a welcome change from staring at SQL databases all day.&lt;/p&gt;
