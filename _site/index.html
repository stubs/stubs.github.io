<p>Anytime I have a chance to make something visual out of my work I jump at the
opportunity. I recently had some free time on my hands, and lo and behold I also had my
interests piqued by this recent <a href="https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-dash-5ecf7191b503">announcement</a> by Plotly!</p>

<p>This post will be the first of two in a short series giving a <u>quick</u> walkthrough
of how we can use pandas and Dash to make a simple Line &amp; Scatter plot. In this
first post, we will focus only on the data wrangling portion of things. The code
is available on my GitHub at:</p>

<h3 id="prepping-data-w-pandas">Prepping Data w/ pandas</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, we are going to be using pandas and Dash (and a few other packages)
for this lesson.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>

<p>I hope by now that many (if not all) of y’all have already had your
ears talked off with the wealth of blog posts, PyCon tutorials, etc lauding pandas for
Data Wrangling and Data Analysis. When I first started working in Python, I was reluctant
to rely on pandas and preferred to roll my own functions for all my data wrangling needs. I
really wish that I would have been more open to using it earlier. It has done nothing but
increase my productivity when it comes to working with CSV data.</p>

<p>First, we are going to want to read in the data file to model the data in a
Dataframe object (one of two data structures that pandas brings to Python). For brevity,
I am only going to be showing a portion of the 213 rows that are in this CSV.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#read in excel data</span>
<span class="n">data_df</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pd</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read_excel</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"data/aug_dec_2016.xlsx"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/public/dash/dataframe.png" alt="dataframe" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>For those of you wondering about the “NaT” value in some of the cells, we can
read those cells as having no value entered in them. They are essentially NULL.</p>

<p>Next, I am going to add two new columns, one named “period” and one named “rperiod” (the r is
for returns). To extract the YYYY-MM from the two date columns we can use a lambda
function to convert the dates to strings and take a slice of the 7 left most characters in
the date column. Under the second comment in the code snippet below, we can see that
I am <em>applying</em> that lambda function to the “dateordered” and “datereturned” columns
in our dataframe.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#lambda function to get monthly periods from date fields</span>
<span class="n">to_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)[:</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">]</span>

</div>

<p>I just recently discovered the pandas <code class="highlighter-rouge">where</code> statement for adding a touch of conditional
flare to manipulating our data. Let’s look at the code first and then we’ll step through
what the details.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#add returns column to separate true orders from true returns</span>
<span class="n">data_df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'returns'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data_df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">orders</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data_df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">orderstatus</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">'returned'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">data_df</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'orders'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data_df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">orders</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data_df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">orderstatus</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">'complete'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Let’s use the first line from directly above as our example. In plain English,
we are adding a new column named “returns” to our dataframe object. Looking to
the already established “orders” column as the source that is going to populate
the new column.  Our <code class="highlighter-rouge">where</code> statement allows us to set conditional rules for how
we are going to populate the new column. The rules for this example state that
for a given row, set the value for “returns” column equal to the value that is
currently in the row’s “order” column <u>IF</u> that row’s “orderstatus” column
is equal to “returned”.  If it is not, set the new “returns” column to the value 0.
I hope that wasn’t <em>too confusing</em>! I hope that because we are turning right
around and doing it once more, except this time I set anything in the “orders”
that did not have an “orderstatus” equal to “complete” to 0. I am left with a
dataframe that is much easier to work with (in my opinion).</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/public/dash/dataframe2.png" alt="dataframe2" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Great! Our dataframe object now has clearly labeled columns for orders AND returns
instead of having everything simply in the “orders” column.  Now let us make 2 new dataframes
by selecting only certain columns we need from our original.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#make new dataframes for returns &amp; orders</span>
<span class="n">returns</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data_df</span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="s">"rperiod"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">"returns"</span><span class="p">]]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">copy</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">orders</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data_df</span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="s">"period"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"orders"</span><span class="p">]]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">copy</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To actually do this with pandas, we simply need to pass a list of the columns we require from
the original dataframe. You will also notice that I am appending a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.copy()</code> as well.
In pandas, indexing a dataframe returns a reference to the initial dataframe.
Thus, changing the subset will change the initial dataframe. This <code class="highlighter-rouge">.copy()</code> will
make these new dataframes independent of the original.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#rename column</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We are nearing the home stretch! The two new dataframes that we created in the
previous step are going to eventually be merged together into a single dataframe.
We are going to want to do this based off a column they both have in common.
As it stands now, returns and orders do not have any columns that are the same.
This can easily be addressed by renaming a column.  I chose to rename the “rperiod”
column in the returns dataframe to just “period”. We could now combine these two
dataframes, but before we actually do that I want to calculate the sum of returns
or orders that take place for each period. This is accomplished by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">.groupby("period")</code>
on each of the two dataframes. groupby() typically refers to a process where we’d
like to split a dataset into groups, apply some function (typically aggregation),
and then combine the groups together. Once all of our periods are grouped together,
we are going to want to apply the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sum()</code> function to the returns and orders columns.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">.to_frame().reset_index()</code> performs a little bit of housekeeping. With these
two function calls we are stating we want our returned object to be a dataframe
(not a series) and that we want the period column to not be an index for the dataframe.
What we get is a set of nice, neat, dataframes of the sums of returns and orders.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/public/dash/returns_sums.png" alt="returns sums" class="center-image" /></p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#merge the two new dataframes</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now we can combine our returns and orders dataframes together. In pandas this is called merging. This is similar to joining in SQL.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/public/dash/month_totals_df.png" alt="returns sums" class="center-image" /></p>

</div>

<p>While we are at it, let us add in some additional columns to see how the rate of returns varies for each monthly period.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#output to excel</span>

<p>Lastly, output the merged dataframe to an excel file.</p>

<p>OK, in the next post we’ll get to how we can create reactive data visualizations for the dataframes we have just worked with to end up with
something similar to what you see below!</p>

     <p> On creating isolated python environments </p>
     <p> <a class = "graybutton" href="/2017/04/10/Virtualenv/">Continue reading</a></p>
     <!--<p>I was a late comer to the the whole virtual environment thing with Python, and 
to be completely honest I have yet to come across any of the potential issues 
that I see cited by everyone as reasons to use them. This being said, I have still developed some 
personal reasons why I like to use them, some of these <em>may or may not be because I am lazy
as all hell</em>….but that is neither here nor there.  Lets jump into virtualenv.</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>
<p>I am more than aware that many of y’all probably already know what the package does,
but for those who are still new to the game and are still exploring the wealth of 
information online about Python, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virutalenv</a>
is a python module that lets you create isolated python environments for whatever 
project you want to work on. I might be misguided in my thinking, but I like to 
think it offers a clean slate for each and every different project you are going to
begin work on.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>This was one of those questions that I asked myself when I first heard about virtualenv. 
When I first started working in Python I was pretty pip-crazy. I kinda loved to just explore all the libraries 
and see what was available. Unfortunately this left my “pip list” output longer 
than I wanted. Sure, I could just go ahead and remove the stuff I didn’t use, 
but who wants to do that. I like the idea of having the packages around for when I want to work 
on said code, but being out of sight when I don’t need to think about them. 
Virtualenv helps with this. Now I simply create a new virtual environment for the 
new python program that I want to work on and pip install any additional package
dependencies. Any of these additional packages that you install will ONLY be 
available in the virtualenv you install them to.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>
<h3 id="installing-virtualenv">Installing virtualenv</h3>
<p>Assuming you already have <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip</code> installed, you are going to want to install virtualenv globally.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install virtualenv
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="creating-a-virtualenv">Creating a virtualenv</h3>
<p>Next, simply cd into the directory you are going to work in. In my example I am going to 
go all <em>Inception</em> and create a virtualenv inside my project directory named…. “vrtlenv”.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/dev/vrtlenv
<span class="gp">$ </span>virtualenv env
New python executable <span class="k">in</span> ~/dev/vrtlenv/env/bin/python2.7
Also creating executable <span class="k">in</span> ~/dev/vrtlenv/env/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">virtualenv env</code> bit is creating a virtual environment to a directory named “env”. It is 
not required that you name it “env”, but it is convention. Also, I would like others looking at 
a project I have started to have to do as little as possible to continue to work. Moving on, to actually 
step into the new virtual environment you need to <em>activate</em> it.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">source </span>env/bin/activate
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You’ll be able to tell that you are in said virtual environment because there will
now be <code class="highlighter-rouge">(env)</code> prepended to the start of your command line prompt (if you chose
to go with a name other than “env” it will show up instead of “env”).</p>

<p>As an additional sanity check you can <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip list</code> once the virtualenv is activated.
If you had any pip packages installed globally you should not see them in the pip
list output from within this virtual environment….because this is an isolated work
environment! Now you can pip install any packages/modules you need for your new python
program and it there will be no worries about whether or not they will cause any kind
of issues with other global packages.</p>

<p>Once you are done working do not forget to <code class="highlighter-rouge">deactivate</code> the virtualenv. Like before
you’ll be able to tell that you have successfully returned to the global environment
by noticing the lack of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">(env)</code> at the start of your command line prompt. Any time 
you ever need to do more work on your project just remember to activate your virtualenv 
by calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ source env/bin/activate</code> from inside the project’s directory!</p>

<hr />

<p>While I have never actually ran into these dependency issues, I got sick of 
removing a ton of stuff from my <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code> output when I was trying to share 
some work with others. ~Lazy, I know.~ I don’t know about y’all, but 
I would rather invest some time to setup these isolated virtual environments 
just to save myself the hassle of having to avoid cleaning up my requirements.txt file.</p>

     <!--<p>I recently traveled out west to see an old buddy of mine.  L.A. always seems to open my eyes up to new things.  While there this time, I was introduced to Processing and P5.js.  This might need a little bit of back story, but let me preface everything that follows by stating that I am a pretty boring dude.  I like numbers and textbooks, but seeing what kind of visual stuff was easily possible left a lasting impression on me.</p>

<p>I (after watching a few youtube videos by Dan Shiffman working in <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a>) was able to create the following purple rain example using the P5.js library.  Initially, I was not really looking forward to working with Javascript, but having something THIS visual helped to get me excited about the entire process. Well…that, and some of the interactive stuff others were doing incorporating other peripherals like the Kinect.</p>

<p>Definitely a welcome change from staring at SQL databases all day.</p>
